#Bike-Sharing Analysis

## Overview of the Bike-Sharing Analysis
NYC has extensive data on their bike sharing program.
Analysis of that data can help determine if bike-sharing would be successful in Des Moines.

### Purpose
Tableau is a powerful tool that allows for easy data visualizations.
With Tableau I created a CitiBike Bike-Sharing story from a csv file of data.
Her is the [link to dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/summer.bell/viz/SummerBell-Challenge14/CitiBikeStory?publish=yes)

## Results

## Bike-Sharing Analysis Summary
A bike-sharing program could be successful in Des Moines.
Additional data about the Des Moines demographics is required.
If there is a large male population that could use bikes to commute to work then this program could be successful.
A pie chart comparing NYC and Des Moines demographics is necessary.
A visualization showing the difference in bike usage during warm summer months and cold winter months is also necessary.
